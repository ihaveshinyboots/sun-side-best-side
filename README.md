# Sun Side Best Side

Some say the west side is the best side. Some say it's the east. For me, it's the sun. I'm sure the people on Reddit will share the same sentiments. Therefore, this app is perfect for all of us who want to sit on the sunny side or face the sun to enjoy the warmth even more in this delightful weather.

## Why you need this app:

- For people with mirror-shine shoes: Sit on the sunny side, let your wax melt, and you'll have a reason to polish your shoes again right before your crazy meeting. Shoe polishing is therapy, right?

- You bought a new phone: You want to use the peak brightness feature to its fullest. What better way than basking in the sun?

- Sun tan: Who needs a beach vacation when you can get a tan on your daily commute?

- Sunflower mimicry: Perfect your impression of a sunflower by always turning to face the sun. Impress your friends and confuse your enemies.

- Warm up your snacks: Forgot to pack lunch? No problem! Leave your snack in the sun for a while and enjoy a warm meal.

## Current limitations:

- No shortest path implementation yet: The app is line-specific. For example, EW Jurong East to NS Bukit Batok won't work. Only NS Jurong East to NS Bukit Batok is supported.

- Sunglasses required: Extended sun exposure might require some stylish shades. But hey, who doesn't look cooler in sunglasses?

## Try it out:
